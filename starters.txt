After the storm,
Before I came home, 
At three o'clock in the afternoon, 
Yesterday night, 
Before the sunrise, 
At noon, 
After the day ended, 
After about sixteen weeks,
As the sun fell, 
As the moon appeared, 
As the day went by, 
Before the day passed, 
At 6:00 o'clock in the evening, 
At 5:00 a.m, 
Before the sunset, 
At the end,
